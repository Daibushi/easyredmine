{"name":"Easy Redmine","tagline":"","body":"# Easy Redmine\r\n\r\nEasy Redmine - plugin to Redmine (http://www.redmine.org)  \r\nCopyright (C) 2008-2013  Easy Software, s.r.o.  \r\nhttps://www.easyredmine.com\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nSame as Redmine 2.3.1. See [redmine_root]/doc/INSTALL\r\n\r\nOnly Ruby 1.8.7 (will be deprecated soon) or 1.9.3 are supported.\r\n\r\nInstalling Redmine and Easy Redmine to virtual directory like http://localhost/redmine is not working.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Make sure your Redmine 2.3.1 is working.  \r\n   For more details visit http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Installation_Guide.\r\n\r\n2. Backup your Redmine database and folder if something make wrong.\r\n\r\n3. Extract zip package to the Redmine plugins directory ([redmine_root]/plugins).  \r\n   The directory structure will look like:  \r\n     [redmine_root]/plugins/easyproject/easy_helpers/*  \r\n     [redmine_root]/plugins/easyproject/easy_plugins/easy_extensions/*  \r\n     [redmine_root]/plugins/easyproject/easy_plugins/easy_redmine/*  \r\n     [redmine_root]/plugins/easyproject/easy_plugins/*  \r\n\r\n4. More gems are required. Under the application main directory run:  \r\n     **bundle install --without development test**\r\n   \r\n   If ImageMagick is not installed on your system, you should skip the installation\r\n   of the rmagick gem using:  \r\n     **bundle install --without development test rmagick**\r\n\r\n5. Under the application main directory run (if you are using bitnami write 'sudo' before 'bundle'):  \r\n     **bundle exec rake easyproject:install RAILS_ENV=production**\r\n   \r\n6. If you are migrating from older Ruby version < 1.9 (e.g. 1.8.7) to Ruby version >= 1.9 you have to run:  \r\n     **bundle exec rake easyproject:service_tasks:migrate_to_new_ruby RAILS_ENV=production**\r\n\r\n7. Start your Redmine application server. E.g. under the application main directory run:  \r\n     **bundle exec ruby script/rails server -e production**\r\n\r\n8. You should create a maintanance task to CRON (on Linux) or Scheduled Tasks (on Windows) that\r\n   will be running every 5-15 minutes. This one task aggregates all required tasks such as mail receiving,\r\n   alerts evaluation etc. You should set up required parameters via administration -> scheduled tasks.\r\n   Do not run this task under root, use same user that is used for web server.:\r\n     **bundle exec rake easyproject:scheduler:run_tasks RAILS_ENV=production**\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nEasy Redmine is tested only on MySQL server.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nChangelog is on: http://www.easyredmine.com/news  \r\nFeaures are on: http://www.easyredmine.com/features  \r\nSupport is on: http://www.easyredmine.com/support  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
